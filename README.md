## What I learned

I was struggling with getting my buttons hover effect to work without adding the border on hover and shifting the element on the page. So decided to add the border (which isn't see) on the button but made it transparent. Not sure if this is the best practice, but it was annoying me hovering over it and seeing slight movements.
